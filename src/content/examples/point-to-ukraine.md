title: Can you point to Ukraine on a map?
tag: fun
description: >-
    Created a quick Serverless API and Observable notebook for this interactive
    knowledge test which asked users to point to Ukraine after a cabinet secretary
    asked an NPR anchor if she could. It received a million attempts,
    only 300,000 of which were from bots.
